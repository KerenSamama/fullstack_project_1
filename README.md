This project involves building a fully responsive and content-rich static website on a chosen theme, 
such as an art gallery, movie library, online store, museum, exotic plants, world travels, rental apartments, zoo, sports activities, Judaica artifacts, and more.
Developed collaboratively in pairs using Visual Studio Code, the project requires logical site structure with various linked pages, 
diverse HTML tags, and CSS rules for text display. The website must include internal and external links, media elements, navigation, forms, tables, and lists. 
The design should adapt to at least two different screen sizes using CSS media queries, FlexBox, and Grid for layout. CSS effects and animations may be added in later stages.
The project development involves stages of definition, planning, research, execution, testing, preparation, and presentation, with equal participation from both partners.
